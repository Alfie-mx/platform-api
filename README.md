## Mappedin Web SDK

Welcome to the Mappedin Web SDK Beta. The SDK is pretty stable (and is being used in production enviroments), but it's possible there will be breaking changes before official launch based on partner feedback, and there will definitely be new features, bugfixes and improvements added. Please report any issues you find directly to your Mappedin technical contact.

A comprehensive tutorial will be available soon, but you can see a working demo [here](examples/Demo), and read the [API docs](http://mappedin.github.io/platform-api/).

### Current Version
The current version of the Mappedin Web SDK is v1.8.2, and can be included in your application via script tag, like so:

```
  <script src="https://d1p5cqqchvbqmy.cloudfront.net/websdk/v1.8.2/mappedin.js"></script>
```
